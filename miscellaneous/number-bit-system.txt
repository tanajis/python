to get binary representation of any number 

3 = 2^1  + 1 
here pow of 2 is 1
bits required = pow + 1 = 1+1 =2

as 2^1  + 1 =3
   10 + 1  = 11 (binary)
   
  
 Ex. 18
 18 = 16+2 = 2^4 + 2
 pow is 4 hence  bits = 4+1 = 5 bits required
 10000 + 10 = 10010
 This Binary of 18 is  10010
 
 Ex. 68
 68  = 64 + 4 = 2^6   + 2^2  =1000000 +100 =  1000100
