Method 1:

to get binary representation of any number 

3 = 2^1  + 1 
here pow of 2 is 1
bits required = pow + 1 = 1+1 =2

as 2^1  + 1 =3
   10 + 1  = 11 (binary)
   
  
 Ex. 18
 18 = 16+2 = 2^4 + 2
 pow is 4 hence  bits = 4+1 = 5 bits required
 10000 + 10 = 10010
 This Binary of 18 is  10010
 
 Ex. 68
 68  = 64 + 4 = 2^6   + 2^2  =1000000 +100 =  1000100

Simple method : 2

1.Store the remainder when the number is divided by 2 in an array.
2.Divide the number by 2
3.Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.
4.Print the array in reverse order now.

Ex.  12
12/2 --rem 0
6/2  --rem 0
3/2 ---rem 1
1  ---rem 1

rem array = [0,0,1,1]
binary of 12 = reverse of array = 1100
