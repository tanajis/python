-A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
 1.It’s a complete tree (All node expect leaf 2 child and leaf should be as left as possible)
 2.It must be min or max
    min : every parent(including root) must be min than child
    max : every parent(including root) must be max than child


Applications of Heap:
    1.used in heap Sort (O(nLogn) time)
    2.used in Priority Queue

    program:
    a) K’th Largest Element in an array.
    b) Sort an almost sorted array/
    c) Merge K Sorted Arrays.

Operations:(for min heap)
    1.getMini() : It returns the root element of Min Heap
    2.extractMin():Removes the minimum element from MinHeap
    3. insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. 
          1.Add a NEW key at the END of the tree 
          2.IF new key is greater than its parent -->keep as it is
          else we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
    
    4.delete(): Deleting a key also takes O(Logn) time. 
    We replace the key to be deleted with minum infinite by calling decreaseKey(). 
    After decreaseKey(), the minus infinite value must reach root, 
    so we call extractMin() to remove the key.

    5.decreaseKey()
