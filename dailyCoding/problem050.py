Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).



Solution:
  
  function calculate(node,stk)
  step 1:if leafnode is return int value
  step 2:if internal node push to stack
  step 3: leftval =  calculate(left,stk) recursively.
          rightval = calculate(right,stk) recursively.
          operator = pop stack
          return (leftVal operator rightval)
